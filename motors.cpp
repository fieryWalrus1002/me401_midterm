    /*  
    *  Motors class and functions for controlling the robot movement in space
    *  Written by Magnus Wood (magnus.wood@wsu.edu) on 4-4-22
    *  Modified 4-6-22
    *  For ME401 Spring 22 miderm robot project
    * 
    * 
    * Structs:
    *   - RobotVars: I was thinking of usign this as a container that could be updated
    *       by functions whenever variables changed, so I could send a single struct
    *       by serial and get a great deal of information out instead of printing out
    *       csv type values. I ahven't finished it yet. 
    * 
    *   - PIDVars: a struct containing useful information about the PID variables, used
    *       to keep track of integral, limits, k gains, etc. Each PID controller needs
    *       its own vars. hVars is heading, vVars is velocity PID controlle vars.
    * 
    * Classes:
    *   - motors, Motors(): the class and the object of the motors. Keeps motor
    *       functions organized.
    *       Functions:
    *           - setHeadingKp(): convenience function for setting Kp for heading
    *               via serial debug. Intended to be used to control the tightness of
    *               turns by dynamically modifying Kp of heading PID controller.
    *               
    *           - setVelocityKp(): same, but for velocity. 
    *           - commandMotors(double, double): Take a -1 to +1 value and turn that
    *               into the 0 - 180 values we feed to the Servo class for each motor.
    *           - pidCalc(PIDVars*, double): returns a double corresponding to PID
    *               output. Does all the calculations, using the variables passed in
    *               as PIDVars, and the input being the error. 
    * 
    *           - update(NavPoint navpoint, bool debug):  This function does too much.
    *               It is the function responsible for keeping the robot moving toward
    *               its goal. It should be refactored. 
    *               Currently it takes in the goal navpoint and then:
    *                   1.  uses navsystem functions to calculate the position, 
    *                   heading and distance of the navpoint relative to the robot
    *                   2. calculates and normalizes error to 0-1 range
    *                   3. feeds that error to the piDCalc() functions
    *                   4. takes output and passes it to commandMotors()
    *                 
    *               
    *
